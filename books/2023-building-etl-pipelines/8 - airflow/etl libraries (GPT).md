## Popular ETL libraries for Python

There are several popular **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** libraries in Python that make data pipelines more efficient. Here are some of the most widely used ones:

### **1. pandas**  

- **Best for**: Small to medium-scale ETL tasks  
- **Use case**: Data wrangling, cleaning, and transformation  
- **Pros**:  
  - Powerful DataFrame operations  
  - Easy to use for data cleaning and transformations  
  - Good for working with CSV, Excel, and databases (via `SQLAlchemy`)  
- **Cons**:  
  - Not built for large-scale ETL  
  - Can be slow with large datasets  

   **Example:**  

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")  # Extract
   df["new_col"] = df["old_col"] * 2  # Transform
   df.to_sql("table_name", con=db_connection, if_exists="replace")  # Load
   ```

### **2. Apache Airflow**  

- **Best for**: Complex, large-scale ETL workflows  
- **Use case**: Scheduling, orchestrating, and monitoring data pipelines  
- **Pros**:  
  - Highly scalable  
  - DAG-based (Directed Acyclic Graph) workflow management  
  - Integrates with cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure)  
- **Cons**:  
  - Setup can be complex  
  - Requires more system resources  

   **Example:**  

   ```python
   from airflow import DAG
   from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
   from datetime import datetime

   def extract():
       # Extract logic

   dag = DAG("etl_pipeline", schedule_interval="@daily", start_date=datetime(2024, 1, 1))
   task = PythonOperator(task_id="extract_task", python_callable=extract, dag=dag)
   ```

### **3. Luigi**  

- **Best for**: Batch processing and dependency management  
- **Use case**: Building modular ETL workflows  
- **Pros**:  
  - Task dependency management  
  - Built-in visualization tool  
  - Works well for batch ETL tasks  
- **Cons**:  
  - Less active development compared to Airflow  
  - Not ideal for real-time streaming  

   **Example:**  

   ```python
   import luigi

   class ExtractData(luigi.Task):
       def output(self):
           return luigi.LocalTarget("data.csv")
       def run(self):
           with self.output().open("w") as f:
               f.write("sample data")
   ```

### **4. Kedro**  

- **Best for**: Data engineering and machine learning pipelines  
- **Use case**: Structuring ML/ETL projects  
- **Pros**:  
  - Enforces good software engineering practices  
  - Works well with ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)  
- **Cons**:  
  - Requires learning its structure  
  - Can be overkill for simple ETL

### **5. PySpark (Apache Spark)**  

- **Best for**: Big data ETL  
- **Use case**: Distributed data processing  
- **Pros**:  
  - Handles huge datasets efficiently  
  - Parallel computing  
- **Cons**:  
  - Requires Spark setup  
  - More complex than pandas  

   **Example:**  

   ```python
   from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
   spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("ETL").getOrCreate()
   df = spark.read.csv("data.csv", header=True)
   df.show()
   ```

### **6. Dask**  

- **Best for**: Parallel computing for large datasets  
- **Use case**: Handling large DataFrames (similar to pandas)  
- **Pros**:  
  - Works well with out-of-core computations  
  - Scalable pandas alternative  
- **Cons**:  
  - Less feature-rich than Spark  

---

### **7. Bonobo**  

- **Best for**: Simple ETL with parallel execution  
- **Use case**: ETL pipelines with low overhead  
- **Pros**:  
  - Lightweight and easy to use  
  - Parallel execution support  
- **Cons**:  
  - Less widely adopted than Airflow or Luigi  

---

### **8. Prefect**  

- **Best for**: Modern workflow orchestration  
- **Use case**: Managing data pipelines  
- **Pros**:  
  - Works like Airflow but with a simpler setup  
  - Supports real-time execution and dynamic DAGs  
- **Cons**:  
  - Smaller community than Airflow

### **Which One Should You Use?**  

- **Small ETL (CSV, databases, quick jobs)** → `pandas`  
- **Complex workflows with scheduling** → `Airflow` or `Prefect`  
- **Batch processing with dependency tracking** → `Luigi`  
- **Big data (Spark-based ETL)** → `PySpark` or `Dask`  
- **Machine learning pipelines** → `Kedro`  
- **Lightweight, easy-to-use ETL** → `Bonobo`
