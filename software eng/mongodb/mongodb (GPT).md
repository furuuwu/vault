## QUESTION: overview of mongodb

MongoDB is a **NoSQL database** designed for flexibility, scalability, and performance. Unlike traditional relational databases, MongoDB stores data in a **document-oriented** format, making it well-suited for modern applications with complex and evolving data structures.

---

### **Key Features of MongoDB**

#### 1. **Document-Oriented**

- Data is stored in **JSON-like documents** (BSON format internally).
- Each document is a collection of key-value pairs, similar to Python dictionaries.
- Flexible schemas allow each document in a collection to have different fields and data types.

#### 2. **Collections**

- Documents are grouped into **collections**, which are similar to tables in relational databases.
- Collections do not enforce a fixed schema.

#### 3. **Scalability**

- Supports **horizontal scaling** through sharding (distributing data across multiple servers).
- Handles large volumes of data efficiently.

#### 4. **High Performance**

- Optimized for read and write operations.
- Uses memory-mapped storage to boost performance.

#### 5. **Rich Query Language**

- Supports CRUD operations, aggregation, indexing, and advanced querying.
- Queries use a flexible, JSON-like syntax.

#### 6. **Indexing**

- Indexes can be created on any field to improve query performance.
- Supports compound, geospatial, and text indexes.

#### 7. **Replication**

- Provides **high availability** through replica sets.
- Replica sets consist of a primary node and multiple secondary nodes for failover.

#### 8. **Sharding**

- Distributes data across shards to scale horizontally.
- Each shard is a replica set to ensure redundancy.

#### 9. **Integration with Big Data**

- Works seamlessly with frameworks like Apache Hadoop and Spark for big data processing.

### **Core Concepts**

#### **1. Document**

A single data record, stored in BSON (binary JSON). Example:

```json
{
  "_id": "001",
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 30,
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "New York"
  }
}
```

#### **2. Collection**

A group of related documents, similar to a table in SQL.

#### **3. Database**

A container for collections. Each database has its own collections and documents.

#### **4. _id Field**

Every document has a unique `_id` field, which acts as the primary key.

---

### **Common Use Cases**

1. **Web Applications**
   - Flexible schema design is ideal for user profiles, blogs, and e-commerce platforms.
2. **IoT and Sensor Data**
   - Efficiently handles large volumes of time-series data.
3. **Content Management Systems**
   - Stores dynamic content with varied structures.
4. **Big Data Analytics**
   - Works well with tools like Hadoop for processing and analyzing large datasets.

---

### **CRUD Operations**

#### **1. Create**

Inserts new documents into a collection.

```javascript
db.users.insertOne({
  name: "Alice",
  age: 30,
  email: "alice@example.com"
});
```

#### **2. Read**

Queries documents from a collection.

```javascript
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } });
```

#### **3. Update**

Updates existing documents.

```javascript
db.users.updateOne(
  { name: "Alice" },
  { $set: { age: 31 } }
);
```

#### **4. Delete**

Removes documents from a collection.

```javascript
db.users.deleteOne({ name: "Alice" });
```

---

### **Advanced Features**

#### **1. Aggregation Framework**

Performs data processing, transformation, and analysis using a pipeline of stages.

Example:

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$customerId", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } }
]);
```

#### **2. Transactions**

Supports multi-document ACID transactions to ensure consistency.

#### **3. Geospatial Queries**

Enables queries based on location data.

```javascript
db.places.find({
  location: {
    $near: {
      $geometry: { type: "Point", coordinates: [40, -73] },
      $maxDistance: 5000
    }
  }
});
```

       authorization: enabled
     ```

   - Create admin users using the `mongo` shell:

     ```javascript
     use admin
     db.createUser({
       user: "admin",
       pwd: "password",
       roles: ["root"]
     });
     ```

4. **Allow Remote Access:**
   - Update firewall rules to allow connections on port `27017`.

5. **Test the Deployment:**
   - Use `mongosh` or a MongoDB client to connect:

     ```bash
     mongosh "mongodb://<server-ip>:27017"
     ```

---

### **3. Deploying MongoDB on the Cloud**

#### **Option 1: Using Docker on a Cloud VM**

1. **Set up a Cloud VM:**
   - Create a virtual machine on AWS EC2, Azure VM, or Google Compute Engine.
   - Install Docker and Docker Compose on the VM.

2. **Deploy MongoDB with Docker Compose:**
   - Transfer your `docker-compose.yaml` file to the VM using `scp`:

     ```bash
     scp docker-compose.yaml user@server-ip:/path/to/deploy
     ```

   - SSH into the VM:

     ```bash
     ssh user@server-ip
     ```

   - Run the services:

     ```bash
     docker compose up -d
     ```

3. **Secure Access:**
   - Configure the VM’s firewall or security group to allow connections only from trusted IPs.

#### **Option 2: Direct Installation**

1. **Follow the On-Premise Steps:**
   Install and configure MongoDB directly on the VM.
