## install Java on WSL

To install Java on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), follow the steps below based on the version of Java you want to install (e.g., OpenJDK 8, OpenJDK 11, or OpenJDK 17). Here, I'll show you the steps for installing **OpenJDK** using Ubuntu on WSL.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Open Your WSL Terminal

Make sure you have a working WSL environment. If you're using Ubuntu on WSL, open the Ubuntu terminal.

#### 2. Update Package Lists

Before installing anything, it's a good practice to update the package lists for the latest available versions.

```bash
sudo apt update
```

#### 3. Install OpenJDK

##### Option 1: Install OpenJDK 11 (Recommended for Most Use Cases)

To install OpenJDK 11, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
```

##### Option 2: Install OpenJDK 8 (Older Version)

If you need OpenJDK 8, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
```

##### Option 3: Install OpenJDK 17 (Latest Long-Term Support)

To install OpenJDK 17, use:

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
```

#### 4. Verify the Installation

After installation, you can verify that Java was installed successfully by checking the Java version:

```bash
java -version
```

You should see output similar to this for OpenJDK 11 (depending on the version installed):

```bash
openjdk version "11.0.x" 202x-xx-xx
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.x+xxx)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0.x+xxx, mixed mode)
```

For OpenJDK 8:

```bash
openjdk version "1.8.0_xx"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_xx-bxx)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.x-bxx, mixed mode)
```

#### 5. Set JAVA_HOME (Optional but Recommended)

Itâ€™s often useful to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable so that Java applications can easily find your Java installation.

First, find the path where Java is installed:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

This will give you a list of available Java versions. For example, you might see something like:

```none
There are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                 Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java  1111      auto mode
  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin/java  1111      manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/bin/java  1081      manual mode
```

Take the path from your desired Java version (e.g., `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64`).

Then, set the `JAVA_HOME` variable by adding this line to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` (depending on your shell):

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
```

Then, load the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Finally, verify that `JAVA_HOME` is set correctly:

```bash
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

It should output the path you set, for example:

```bash
/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
```

#### 6. Set Default Java Version (Optional)

If you have multiple versions of Java installed and want to set a default version for your system, you can use `update-alternatives`:

```bash
sudo update-alternatives --config java
```

This command will present a list of Java versions installed on your system, and you can select the one you want to set as default.

#### 7. Install Java Development Tools (Optional)

If you need tools like `javac` for compiling Java programs, ensure that the development package (`-jdk`) is installed (which you did earlier with `openjdk-11-jdk`, for example). You can install just the Java compiler package with:

```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk-headless
```

---

### Summary

1. Open your WSL terminal.
2. Update package lists: `sudo apt update`.
3. Install Java with one of these commands:
   - `sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk` for OpenJDK 11.
   - `sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk` for OpenJDK 8.
   - `sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk` for OpenJDK 17.
4. Verify with `java -version`.
5. Optionally, set `JAVA_HOME` in `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.
6. Set default Java version with `update-alternatives`.

Now, you should have Java installed and ready to use on your WSL environment!
