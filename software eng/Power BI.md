# Power BI

Learning:

* [Microsoft training](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/browse/?filter-products=power&products=power-bi&resource_type=module)

Some notes:

* sharing the work

  * i can share the whole workspace, an app or a link to a specific object.
  * Public link is the least secure option
  * An app is a curated version of a workspace (edited)
  * publish with import vs direct query. Direct query is useful for real-time data and to not load all the data (big data case)

* incremental refresh
  * i can include incremental refresh in parts of the documents.
