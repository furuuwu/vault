# List SSH keys
To list your SSH keys, you can follow these steps:

### On Linux/MacOS:
1. Open a terminal.
2. Run the following command to list the files in the SSH directory:
   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.ssh
   ```
   This command will display all the files in the `~/.ssh` directory, including your SSH keys. By convention:
   - Private keys usually have names like `id_rsa`, `id_ecdsa`, or `id_ed25519`.
   - Public keys have a `.pub` extension (e.g., `id_rsa.pub`).

3. Example output:
   ```plaintext
   -rw-------  1 user user  1823 Oct 10 12:00 id_rsa
   -rw-r--r--  1 user user   400 Oct 10 12:00 id_rsa.pub
   ```

### On Windows (Using Git Bash or PowerShell):
1. Open **Git Bash**, **PowerShell**, or a terminal.
2. Run the same command:
   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.ssh
   ```
3. If the `.ssh` directory is not found, your SSH keys may not exist yet, and you'll need to generate one.

---

### Checking for Existing Keys
If you want to confirm whether a specific key is already being used:
1. To display the contents of the public key file:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
   Replace `id_rsa.pub` with the name of your public key file if it's different.
2. Copy this public key if you need to add it to a service like GitHub, GitLab, or a remote server.

---

### If No SSH Keys Exist
If you don't see any keys in the `~/.ssh` directory, you can generate a new SSH key pair:
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
- Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with your email address.
- Follow the prompts to save the key and optionally add a passphrase.

# Generate SSH keys

generate keys
`ssh-keygen -C "ricardo-filipe.abreu@capgemini.com"`

what does that -C mean

The `-C` flag in the `ssh-keygen` command is used to specify a **comment** to be embedded in the generated SSH key. This comment is often used to help identify the key, such as associating it with an email address or a username. 

### Purpose
When generating an SSH key pair, the public key typically includes a comment at the end of the file. This comment is purely informational and has no functional effect on the SSH key itself. It helps users distinguish between multiple keys.

### Example

Running the command:
```bash
ssh-keygen -C "ricardo-filipe.abreu@capgemini.com"
```

Produces a public key file (`id_rsa.pub` by default) with a line like this:
```
ssh-rsa AAAAB3...rest_of_the_key... ricardo-filipe.abreu@capgemini.com
```

Here, `ricardo-filipe.abreu@capgemini.com` is the comment.

### Practical Use
- **Identification**: Makes it easy to identify keys, especially when you have multiple keys stored in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` on a server.
- **Auditing**: Allows team members to know who owns a specific key without needing to cross-reference.

If you omit the `-C` flag, `ssh-keygen` will ask for a comment interactively, defaulting to the current username and hostname (e.g., `user@hostname`).


### Understanding SSH Key Options

When you generate an SSH key, there are several options that you can configure. Here’s what they mean:

---

### Key Options Explained

1. **`-t <type>`**: Specifies the type of key to generate.
   - Example: `rsa`, `ed25519`, `ecdsa`, etc.
   - **Default**: `rsa` in older versions, but newer versions default to `ed25519` because it is faster and more secure.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519
     ```

2. **`-b <bits>`**: Specifies the number of bits in the key.
   - Only applies to RSA or DSA keys.
   - Example: `2048`, `4096` for RSA.
   - **Default**: `2048` bits.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
     ```

3. **`-C <comment>`**: Specifies a comment for the public key.
   - This is typically used to identify the key (e.g., an email address or a description like `work-laptop-key`).
   - The comment is **optional** and does not affect the functionality of the key. It's purely informational.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
     ```

4. **`-f <filename>`**: Specifies the file name to save the private key.
   - If not specified, the private key will be saved as `~/.ssh/id_<type>` (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).
   - Example:
     ```bash
     ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/github_rsa
     ```

5. **Passphrase (optional)**:
   - During key generation, you are prompted for a passphrase. This encrypts the private key, adding a layer of security.
   - If left blank, the private key is not encrypted, meaning anyone with access to the key file can use it.

---

### If You Don’t Specify an Email (`-C` Option)
- **Any email can use it?**  
  No, the `-C` option is just a comment. It **does not link the key to a specific email address** or restrict its use to that email. 
  - The key is tied to the private key file and the system that has the private key.
  - The comment (e.g., an email) is for your convenience to identify the purpose or owner of the key.

- **If no comment is specified**:
  - The comment will default to the system's current username and hostname.
  - Example:
    ```plaintext
    user@hostname
    ```

---

### Can Any Email Use the Key?
- **No**, the email (or comment) does not control access to the key.
- The private key file (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa`) is what allows access. To use the key, you must:
  - Have the private key file on your system.
  - Set up the corresponding public key on the server (e.g., GitHub, remote machine).

---

### Example of a Key with and Without an Email
1. **With Email**:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "user@example.com"
   ```
   Public key contents:
   ```plaintext
   ssh-rsa AAAAB3... user@example.com
   ```

2. **Without Email**:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa
   ```
   Public key contents:
   ```plaintext
   ssh-rsa AAAAB3... user@hostname
   ```

---

### Summary
- The `-C` option (email) is **purely for identification purposes** and has no impact on the functionality or restrictions of the key.
- If you don’t specify an email, SSH will default to your system username and hostname.
- Access to the SSH key depends on possession of the private key file, not the email or comment.

# Adding a key to a SSH agent

Adding an SSH key to the **SSH agent** serves to streamline the authentication process when using SSH. Here’s an explanation of its purpose and benefits:

### What Does `ssh-add` Do?
The command:
```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```
adds your private SSH key (`id_ed25519` in this example) to the **SSH agent**, a background process that caches your private keys and manages their use.

### Benefits of Adding a Key to the SSH Agent
1. **Convenient Authentication**:
   - Without the SSH agent, you'd need to specify the private key explicitly every time you connect to a server or run an SSH-related command:
     ```bash
     ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 user@host
     ```
   - After adding the key to the agent, SSH automatically uses the cached key, making connections seamless.

2. **Avoid Repeated Password Prompts**:
   - If your private key is encrypted with a passphrase, you'll be prompted to enter the passphrase every time the key is used.
   - Adding the key to the agent unlocks it once, and the agent securely remembers it for subsequent use during your session.

3. **Centralized Key Management**:
   - When you have multiple keys (e.g., for different servers or services), the agent can store and manage them, allowing SSH to pick the right key for each connection automatically.

4. **Security Benefits**:
   - Your private key remains in memory (within the agent) instead of being read repeatedly from disk, reducing the risk of accidental exposure.
   - Some SSH agents (e.g., `ssh-agent` or `gpg-agent`) enforce additional security policies, like requiring explicit permission for key use.

### Example Workflow
1. Start the SSH agent:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```
   (This starts the agent if it’s not already running.)

2. Add your private key:
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```
   You'll be prompted for the key's passphrase if it has one.

3. Use SSH commands as usual:
   ```bash
   ssh user@remote-host
   ```

Now, the key stored in the agent will be used automatically for authentication.

### Key Removal
If you need to remove a key from the agent:
```bash
ssh-add -d ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Or to remove all keys:
```bash
ssh-add -D
```

### Summary
Adding your SSH key to the agent simplifies secure authentication and reduces friction in workflows involving multiple SSH connections. It’s especially useful for developers, sysadmins, or anyone needing frequent SSH access to various servers.

# Can you save multiple SSH keys to the same file?

No, you cannot save multiple SSH keys to the same key file (e.g., `~/.ssh/id_rsa`). Each SSH key pair consists of a private key and a corresponding public key, and each key pair should be stored in its own file. However, you **can manage multiple SSH keys** effectively with Git and SSH by using the following techniques:

---

### **Approach 1: Use Multiple Key Files**
- You can have multiple private/public key pairs (e.g., `id_rsa`, `id_ed25519`, `github_rsa`, etc.).
- Assign different keys to different Git repositories or services (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

#### **Steps**:
1. **Generate Multiple SSH Keys**:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/github_rsa
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com" -f ~/.ssh/gitlab_rsa
   ```
   This creates two separate key files: `github_rsa` and `gitlab_rsa` in the `~/.ssh` directory.

2. **Add the Keys to Your SSH Agent**:
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/github_rsa
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/gitlab_rsa
   ```

3. **Update the SSH Config File**:
   Create or edit the `~/.ssh/config` file to map each key to a specific service or host:
   ```plaintext
   Host github.com
       HostName github.com
       User git
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github_rsa

   Host gitlab.com
       HostName gitlab.com
       User git
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/gitlab_rsa
   ```

4. **Clone or Work on Repositories**:
   - When you run Git commands (e.g., `git clone`), SSH will use the correct key based on the `Host` entry in the `config` file.

---

### **Approach 2: Use a Single SSH Key for All Repositories**
If you prefer simplicity, you can use a single SSH key pair for multiple services. Just add the same public key to all the Git services you use (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

1. Copy your public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
2. Add the public key to each service's SSH key management page:
   - **GitHub**: [SSH and GPG keys settings](https://github.com/settings/keys)
   - **GitLab**: [SSH Keys settings](https://gitlab.com/-/profile/keys)

---

### **Approach 3: Use Different Keys Per Repository**
For cases where you need different SSH keys for specific Git repositories (e.g., company and personal accounts):

1. Use the SSH `config` file as shown in **Approach 1**.
2. In the repository, update the `remote` URL to match the corresponding `Host` entry in the `~/.ssh/config` file:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
   ```
   or for GitLab:
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin git@gitlab.com:username/repo.git
   ```

---

### **Why Separate Files Are Better**
- **Security**: Each private key has a specific use, so you can revoke or replace them individually without affecting others.
- **Scalability**: Managing multiple services and repositories becomes easier when keys are distinct and mapped via the SSH config.

---

### **Summary**
While you cannot save multiple SSH keys into the same file, you can easily manage multiple keys using:
- Separate files for each key.
- An SSH config file to specify which key to use for different services or repositories.
This method is secure, flexible, and works seamlessly with Git and SSH.


# Configuring the SSH client to manage multiple SSH keys

The `~/.ssh/config` file is **not created automatically**. You need to create and configure it yourself if you want to manage multiple SSH keys or customize your SSH connections.

---

### **What Is the `~/.ssh/config` File?**
The `~/.ssh/config` file is a configuration file for the SSH client. It allows you to:
- Specify settings for different hosts (e.g., GitHub, servers).
- Assign specific SSH keys to specific services or repositories.
- Simplify SSH commands by defining shortcuts (e.g., using `github-capgemini.com` instead of `github.com`).

---

### **Should I Create the File?**
Yes, you should create it if:
1. You are managing multiple SSH keys (as in your case).
2. You want to customize SSH behavior for specific hosts.

If you don’t create it, SSH will use the default configuration:
- Look for the default private key (`~/.ssh/id_rsa` or `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`).
- Connect to the host with no additional settings.

---

### **How to Create the File?**
1. **Check if the File Already Exists**:
   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.ssh/config
   ```
   - If the file exists, you can edit it with a text editor (e.g., `nano ~/.ssh/config`).

2. **If It Doesn’t Exist, Create It**:
   ```bash
   touch ~/.ssh/config
   chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
   ```

   The `chmod 600` command ensures the file is only readable and writable by you, which is important for security.

3. **Add Your Configuration**:
   Paste your SSH configuration into the file:
   ```plaintext
   # Default account
   Host github.com
       Hostname github.com
       User git
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

   # Capgemini account
   Host github-capgemini.com
       Hostname github.com
       User git
       IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_capgemini
   ```

4. **Save and Exit**:
   Use your text editor's save command (e.g., `CTRL + O` and `CTRL + X` in nano).

---

### **How to Use the Config File?**
Once the `~/.ssh/config` file is set up:
- SSH will automatically use the specified key when connecting to the matching `Host` in the file.
- You can reference the `Host` entries in Git commands.

**Example for Git Commands**:
- For your default account:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
  ```
- For your Capgemini account:
  ```bash
  git clone git@github-capgemini.com:username/repository.git
  ```

---

### **Summary**
- The `~/.ssh/config` file is not created automatically; you should create it manually if needed.
- It simplifies managing multiple SSH keys and configurations for different hosts or accounts.
- Make sure the file has proper permissions (`chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config`) to ensure security.
