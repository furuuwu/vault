# docker compose up flags

The `--build` flag and the `-d` flag in the `docker compose up` command serve different purposes:

---

### **1. `--build` Flag**
   - **Purpose:** Forces the rebuild of Docker images before starting the containers.
   - **Use Case:** 
     - When you’ve made changes to the `Dockerfile` or files copied into the image (e.g., application code, dependencies).
     - When you want to ensure that you’re using the latest code or configuration in your container.
   - **Behavior:** 
     - If you run `docker compose up --build`, it rebuilds the images for all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file before starting the containers.
     - Without `--build`, Docker Compose skips the image build step and uses the existing images if available.

   **Example:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   This rebuilds the images for all services in your `docker-compose.yml`.

---

### **2. `-d` Flag**
   - **Purpose:** Runs containers in detached mode (in the background).
   - **Use Case:**
     - When you don’t want the container logs to take over your terminal session.
     - Useful for running containers as background processes.
   - **Behavior:**
     - The containers start, and you regain control of your terminal immediately.
     - Logs can still be accessed using `docker compose logs`.

   **Example:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
   This starts the services defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file in the background.

---

### **Using Them Together**
You can combine the flags if you want to rebuild images and start containers in detached mode:
```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```
This will:
1. Rebuild the images for all services.
2. Start the containers in the background.

### **Key Differences**
| Flag          | Description                                      | Example Usage                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `--build`     | Rebuilds Docker images before starting services. | `docker compose up --build`               |
| `-d`          | Runs containers in detached mode (background).  | `docker compose up -d`                    |
| Combined      | Rebuild and run in detached mode.                | `docker compose up --build -d`            |

## How to keep conatiner and local dependencies in sync?

To avoid manual synchronization between the container and your local environment when installing dependencies, you can use the following strategies:

---

### **1. Use a `requirements.txt` File for Python Dependencies**
- Maintain a `requirements.txt` file in your project directory.
- Mount this file into the container and ensure the container installs these dependencies when it starts.
- Update your local virtual environment from the same file.

#### **Steps:**
1. Create or update your `requirements.txt` file locally:
   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

2. Modify the `Dockerfile` to install dependencies from this file:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM jupyter/base-notebook:latest
   COPY requirements.txt /tmp/
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r /tmp/requirements.txt
   ```

3. Add the custom `Dockerfile` to your `docker-compose.yml`:
   ```yaml
   services:
     jupyter:
       build:
         context: .
         dockerfile: Dockerfile
       volumes:
         - ./notebooks:/home/jovyan/work
         - ./requirements.txt:/tmp/requirements.txt
   ```

4. Locally, whenever you add a new dependency:
   ```bash
   pip install <package>
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

---

### **2. Use an Automated Dependency Syncing Script**
Write a script that syncs dependencies both inside the container and locally. Here’s how you could do it:

#### **Script: `sync-deps.sh`**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Sync Python dependencies inside the container and locally
CONTAINER_NAME=jupyter

# 1. Install dependencies locally
echo "Installing dependencies locally..."
pip freeze > requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Sync dependencies in the container
echo "Installing dependencies in the container..."
docker exec -it $CONTAINER_NAME pip install -r /home/jovyan/work/requirements.txt

echo "Dependencies synced successfully!"
```

Run this script after adding new dependencies.

---

### **3. Leverage Persistent Docker Volumes**
If you want the container environment to "remember" what you've installed even after restarting, use a persistent volume to store Python packages. 

#### **Steps:**
1. Mount a volume to the Python package directory:
   ```yaml
   services:
     jupyter:
       volumes:
         - ./notebooks:/home/jovyan/work
         - pip_cache:/home/jovyan/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages
   volumes:
     pip_cache:
   ```

2. Install packages inside the container:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it jupyter pip install <package>
   ```

3. Ensure `requirements.txt` is updated so you can replicate the environment if needed:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it jupyter pip freeze > /home/jovyan/work/requirements.txt
   ```

---

### **4. Use Conda for Jupyter (Optional)**
If you’re using Jupyter’s base-notebook image, you can also leverage Conda, which is preinstalled. This allows easy management of environments and dependencies.

#### **Steps:**
1. Create a `environment.yml` file:
   ```yaml
   name: myenv
   channels:
     - conda-forge
   dependencies:
     - numpy
     - pandas
     - scikit-learn
   ```

2. Modify the `Dockerfile` to apply the environment:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM jupyter/base-notebook:latest
   COPY environment.yml /tmp/
   RUN conda env update --file /tmp/environment.yml && conda clean --all
   ```

3. Locally, you can replicate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yml
   conda activate myenv
   ```

---

### **5. Sync Both Environments Automatically**
Combine the strategies:
- Use `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` as the source of truth.
- Automate the process with a `sync-deps.sh` script.
- Use Docker volumes to persist dependencies within the container for quicker iteration.

## ERROR - custom network not found

It seems that the `custom_network` network is still not being created, even though it is specified in your `docker-compose.yml` file. This could happen for several reasons, but let’s troubleshoot and ensure the network is properly created.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Network Creation in Docker Compose**: Normally, when you run `docker compose up`, it should automatically create the specified networks in the `docker-compose.yml`. If it’s not happening, there could be some issue with Docker Compose or the way it's being used.

2. **Docker Compose File Version**: Since you are using Docker Compose version 3.8, there could be issues with the version or Docker Compose setup.

### Let's go step by step:

### Step 1: Ensure the `docker-compose.yml` file is correct
Check that the `networks` section in your `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly defined. It should look like this:

```yaml
networks:
  custom_network:
    driver: bridge
```

### Step 2: Bring down all containers and remove the network (if exists)
Before re-running the setup, let’s make sure there’s no lingering issue with the previous Docker network. Run:

```bash
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

This will:
- Stop and remove containers,
- Remove networks (including custom networks),
- Remove any unnamed volumes that may be leftover from a failed run.

### Step 3: Rebuild and recreate the containers with the network
After ensuring there are no leftover containers or networks, rebuild and start the containers again:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### Step 4: Verify the network creation
After running the above command, check if the network is created:

```bash
docker network ls
```

Look for `custom_network` in the list.

If the network appears there, you can inspect it with:

```bash
docker network inspect custom_network
```

This should return detailed information about the network, including connected containers.

### Step 5: Manually create the network (if necessary)
If Docker Compose still doesn’t automatically create the network, try manually creating it before starting the containers. Use this command to create the network:

```bash
docker network create custom_network
```

Then, you can run:

```bash
docker compose up
```

After these steps, check the network again with:

```bash
docker network inspect custom_network
```

### Step 6: Debug Docker Compose version
If it still doesn’t work, there might be an issue with your Docker Compose version or installation. Check your version using:

```bash
docker compose version
```

Ensure that you’re using Docker Compose V2 (with the `docker compose` command) and not the legacy V1 (`docker-compose`).
