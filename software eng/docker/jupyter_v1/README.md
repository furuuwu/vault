run a Jupyter Notebook inside a Docker container


1. Create the Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Install Jupyter and other dependencies
# Copy requirements file and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Expose the port for Jupyter
EXPOSE 8888

# Set the default command to run Jupyter Notebook
CMD ["jupyter", "notebook", "--ip=0.0.0.0", "--port=8888", "--no-browser", "--allow-root"]
```

Explanation

`EXPOSE 8888`: This exposes port 8888, which is the default port for Jupyter.

`CMD`: This is the default command that runs when the container starts. It starts the Jupyter Notebook server, binds it to 0.0.0.0 so that it is accessible from outside the container, and specifies port 8888.

2. Build and run

`docker build -t jupyter-notebook-image .`

`docker run -it -p 8888:8888 jupyter-notebook-image`

`-p 8888:8888`: Maps port 8888 on your host machine to port 8888 in the container, allowing you to access Jupyter from your browser.

3. access the notebook

After running the container, Jupyter will start and provide a URL in the terminal, something like:

http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=some_generated_token

Open this URL in your browser to access the Jupyter Notebook interface.
