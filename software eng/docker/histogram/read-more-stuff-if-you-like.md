What to do with a virtual environment?

In the case of Docker, you generally don't need to use a virtual environment (venv) inside the container. This is because Docker already provides isolation for the application through its containers. The container acts as its own environment, so you can install the necessary dependencies directly into the container without worrying about a venv.

You can safely ignore the local virtual environment (venv) when running the application in Docker. Here's how to handle it:
* Do Not Copy the venv Folder into the Docker Image: You should not copy your local venv folder into the Docker container. Instead, you should use the requirements.txt file (or Pipfile if you use pipenv) to install the dependencies inside the container.
* Include Dependencies in requirements.txt
