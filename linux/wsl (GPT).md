# ERROR - why did my user change to devcontainers@LPT-5CG129083D in my wsl?

It seems like you're using a development container environment, likely through a tool like Visual Studio Code's Remote - Containers extension, which runs your code in an isolated development environment. When inside a development container, the default user is often set to a non-root user (like `devcontainers` in your case) for security and consistency.

### Why the Change to `devcontainers`
- **Configured in the container setup**: The `devcontainers` user is typically defined in the container's `Dockerfile` or `devcontainer.json` configuration file.
- **Default behavior**: By default, devcontainers use a non-root user unless explicitly set otherwise.

---

### Switching to Root in WSL/Devcontainers
To switch to the root user inside the container or WSL:

1. **Use the `sudo` command**:
   - If `sudo` is available, you can temporarily execute commands as root:
     ```bash
     sudo su
     ```
     This will switch you to the root user.

2. **Reopen the container with root access**:
   - In VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and search for:
     ```
     Dev Containers: Reopen in Container as Root
     ```
     This will restart the container session as the root user.

3. **Modify the container configuration**:
   - Edit the `devcontainer.json` file and set the `remoteUser` to `root`:
     ```json
     "remoteUser": "root"
     ```
   - Rebuild and reopen the container to apply the changes.

4. **Manually connect to the container as root**:
   - If you have Docker CLI access, you can directly connect to the container as root:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it --user root <container-id> /bin/bash
     ```
     Replace `<container-id>` with the ID of your container. You can find it using:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```

---

If you're not in a container but just using WSL, you can switch to root using:

```bash
sudo su
```

Or modify your WSL profile to log in as root by default:

1. Open the WSL configuration file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.wslconfig
   ```
2. Add or modify the following:
   ```ini
   [user]
   default=root
   ```
3. Restart your WSL session:
   ```bash
   wsl --shutdown
   wsl
   ```

This will set the root user as the default for WSL.

It looks like you're stuck in a user (`devcontainers`) without proper sudo privileges or a known password, and you're not inside a standard Dev Containers environment with a `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` configuration file. This issue might arise from how the environment was set up. Let's work through resolving this:

---

### 1. **Verify If You Are in a Dockerized Environment**
Since there’s a `docker-compose.yml` file in your directory, it’s possible you’re inside a Docker container. Check your environment:

Run this command:
```bash
cat /etc/os-release
```
If you see something like "Ubuntu" and references to "docker" or "containers," then you’re in a Docker container.

To exit the Docker container:
```bash
exit
```

---

### 2. **Check If WSL Defaulted to a Non-root User**
If you're in a plain WSL Ubuntu 22.04 instance but the `devcontainers` user was created by some process, you may not have root access configured. To fix this:

1. Open the **Windows Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** and stop WSL:
   ```cmd
   wsl --shutdown
   ```

2. Reconfigure WSL to launch as the root user:
   - Open or create a file named `.wslconfig` in your Windows home directory:
     ```cmd
     notepad %USERPROFILE%\.wslconfig
     ```
   - Add the following lines:
     ```ini
     [user]
     default=root
     ```
   - Save and close the file.

3. Restart WSL:
   ```cmd
   wsl
   ```

   You should now be logged in as the `root` user.

4. Switch back to your regular user (if desired) and reset the password:
   ```bash
   passwd devcontainers
   ```

---

### 3. **If Still Stuck, Access Root via Windows Terminal**
If you're locked out, WSL allows direct access to the root user:

1. Open a **PowerShell or Command Prompt** and run:
   ```cmd
   wsl -u root
   ```

2. Once logged in as root, reset the `devcontainers` user password:
   ```bash
   passwd devcontainers
   ```

3. Reconfigure WSL to log back in as the `devcontainers` user (if desired):
   - Open `.wslconfig` and set:
     ```ini
     [user]
     default=devcontainers
     ```

---

### 4. **Check Docker and DevContainers Configuration**
If you suspect this issue was caused by a tool like Docker or VS Code:
1. Exit the environment (`exit`).
2. Inspect Docker containers running on your system:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
   If a container is running, stop it:
   ```bash
   docker stop <container-id>
   ```

3. Relaunch WSL to see if the issue persists.

---

### 5. **Reinstall WSL Ubuntu (Last Resort)**
If you’re unable to fix the issue:
1. Backup your data from WSL:
   - Mount the WSL filesystem in Windows Explorer (`\\wsl$`).
   - Copy any important files.

2. Uninstall and reinstall Ubuntu in WSL:
   - Uninstall via the Windows **Settings > Apps** menu.
   - Reinstall Ubuntu from the Microsoft Store.

3. Reconfigure your environment as needed.

---

These steps should help you regain control of your WSL environment and fix the `devcontainers` user issue. Let me know where you're stuck, and we can dig deeper!


# free memory and disk space in WSL

To check how much disk space and memory are free and available in WSL, you can use the following commands:

---

### **1. Disk Space in WSL**
To see how much disk space is free and available:
```bash
df -h
```

#### Output Example:
```
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/sdb        100G   10G   90G  10% /
tmpfs            64M     0   64M   0% /dev
tmpfs           3.9G     0  3.9G   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
```

- **Size:** Total size of the partition.
- **Used:** Amount of space currently used.
- **Avail:** Free space available.
- **Mounted on:** Where the file system is mounted.

Focus on the `/` (root) partition, as this is where WSL stores its data.

---

### **2. Memory Usage in WSL**
To see how much memory is free and available:
```bash
free -h
```

#### Output Example:
```
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           8.0G        2.5G        3.0G        512M        2.5G        5.0G
Swap:          2.0G        512M        1.5G
```

- **total:** Total memory allocated to WSL.
- **used:** Memory currently in use by WSL.
- **free:** Memory that is entirely unused.
- **buff/cache:** Memory used for disk caching and buffers.
- **available:** Memory available for new applications (includes free + reclaimable buff/cache).

---

### **3. Swap Space in WSL**
To check swap usage (virtual memory):
- The `free -h` command above also shows swap space under the "Swap" row.
- Alternatively, use:
  ```bash
  swapon --show
  ```
  This shows details of the swap file if enabled.

---

### **4. Combined Summary**
Run the following commands together to get both disk and memory information:
```bash
df -h
free -h
```

---

### **Checking Limits**
If you’ve set specific memory or disk usage limits for WSL in the `~/.wslconfig` file, WSL will honor those settings. To confirm the limits:
1. Open the `~/.wslconfig` file in Windows (if it exists):
   ```bash
   notepad ~/.wslconfig
   ```
2. Look for entries like:
   ```ini
   [wsl2]
   memory=4GB
   swap=2GB
   ```

If these limits are configured, they will cap the resources available to WSL.
