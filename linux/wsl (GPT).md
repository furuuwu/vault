# ERROR - why did my user change to devcontainers@LPT-5CG129083D in my wsl?

It seems like you're using a development container environment, likely through a tool like Visual Studio Code's Remote - Containers extension, which runs your code in an isolated development environment. When inside a development container, the default user is often set to a non-root user (like `devcontainers` in your case) for security and consistency.

### Why the Change to `devcontainers`
- **Configured in the container setup**: The `devcontainers` user is typically defined in the container's `Dockerfile` or `devcontainer.json` configuration file.
- **Default behavior**: By default, devcontainers use a non-root user unless explicitly set otherwise.

### Switching to Root in WSL/Devcontainers
To switch to the root user inside the container or WSL:

1. **Use the `sudo` command**:
   - If `sudo` is available, you can temporarily execute commands as root:
     ```bash
     sudo su
     ```
     This will switch you to the root user.

2. **Reopen the container with root access**:
   - In VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and search for:
     ```
     Dev Containers: Reopen in Container as Root
     ```
     This will restart the container session as the root user.

3. **Modify the container configuration**:
   - Edit the `devcontainer.json` file and set the `remoteUser` to `root`:
     ```json
     "remoteUser": "root"
     ```
   - Rebuild and reopen the container to apply the changes.

4. **Manually connect to the container as root**:
   - If you have Docker CLI access, you can directly connect to the container as root:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it --user root <container-id> /bin/bash
     ```
     Replace `<container-id>` with the ID of your container. You can find it using:
     ```bash
     docker ps
     ```

---

If you're not in a container but just using WSL, you can switch to root using:

```bash
sudo su
```

Or modify your WSL profile to log in as root by default:

1. Open the WSL configuration file:
   ```bash
   nano ~/.wslconfig
   ```
2. Add or modify the following:
   ```ini
   [user]
   default=root
   ```
3. Restart your WSL session:
   ```bash
   wsl --shutdown
   wsl
   ```

This will set the root user as the default for WSL.
