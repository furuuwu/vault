# Pytorch stuff

practically speaking, this is the most important library

Goals:

* practice
* include projects/experimentation with Kaggle datasets (eventually)

I'll just go through these books

* [2020 Deep learning for coders with fastai and PyTorch, howard REILLY](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Coders-fastai-PyTorch/dp/1492045527/)
  * [website with course/repo](https://course.fast.ai/)
* [2023 Understanding Deep learning, prince MIT](https://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Deep-Learning-Simon-Prince/dp/0262048647/)
  * [website with notebooks](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/)

First book is entry level, second is advanced
