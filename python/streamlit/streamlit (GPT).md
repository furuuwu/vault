## QUESTION: streamlit main concepts

**Streamlit** is an open-source app framework primarily used to create **data applications** and **interactive dashboards** with Python. It is designed to be easy to use, allowing developers and data scientists to build web applications for their data analysis projects with minimal effort, especially for tasks such as creating **interactive visualizations**, **machine learning models**, or **data exploration apps**. Streamlit emphasizes simplicity and rapid prototyping, and it requires no front-end web development experience.

---

### **Main Concepts of Streamlit**

1. **Widgets**:
   Streamlit provides a set of **widgets** (interactive UI elements) that can be used to take user input. These widgets include buttons, sliders, text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, and more. When the user interacts with them, the application updates dynamically.

   **Example**:

   ```python
   import streamlit as st
   
   st.title("Streamlit Widget Example")
   user_input = st.text_input("Enter your name:")
   st.write(f"Hello, {user_input}!")
   ```

   In this example, the app will take the name from the user and greet them in real-time. The text input widget makes it possible for the user to type their name, and the app dynamically responds with a greeting.

2. **Layouts**:
   Streamlit allows you to organize content using **columns** and **tabs**, as well as control the layout of your app using different containers like `st.sidebar`. This helps build complex applications in a structured and clean manner.

   - **Columns**: Create a layout with multiple columns.
   - **Sidebar**: Provides an area for controls and interactive widgets that are placed on the side.
   - **Expander**: A collapsible container for grouping and hiding content.

   **Example**:

   ```python
   import streamlit as st

   # Create a 2-column layout
   col1, col2 = st.columns(2)
   
   col1.button("Button in Column 1")
   col2.button("Button in Column 2")
   ```

   In this example, two buttons are displayed side-by-side in two separate columns.

3. **Data Display**:
   Streamlit makes it easy to display **data** in several formats such as tables, charts, and images. You can display:
   - **DataFrames** (using Pandas)
   - **Charts** (using libraries like Matplotlib, Plotly, Altair, etc.)
   - **Images**
   - **Text and Markdown**

   **Example (Displaying a DataFrame)**:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   import streamlit as st

   # Sample DataFrame
   data = {"name": ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"], "age": [24, 27, 22]}
   df = pd.DataFrame(data)

   st.write(df)  # Displaying the DataFrame
   ```

   In this example, a small DataFrame is created and displayed in the app.

4. **Charts and Visualizations**:
   Streamlit supports a variety of chart types, allowing you to create visualizations with libraries such as **Matplotlib**, **Plotly**, **Altair**, and **Seaborn**.

   **Example (Using Plotly)**:

   ```python
   import streamlit as st
   import plotly.express as px

   # Sample data for plotting
   df = px.data.iris()

   fig = px.scatter(df, x="sepal_width", y="sepal_length", color="species")
   st.plotly_chart(fig)
   ```

   This example demonstrates how to use Plotly to create an interactive scatter plot in the Streamlit app.

5. **Callback Functions and State**:
   Streamlit applications can maintain **state** across user interactions. This allows you to react to user input and update the app based on interactions. You can use `st.session_state` to store and update state variables.

   **Example (State with Button Interaction)**:

   ```python
   import streamlit as st

   if "counter" not in st.session_state:
       st.session_state.counter = 0

   def increment_counter():
       st.session_state.counter += 1

   st.button("Increment", on_click=increment_counter)
   st.write(f"Counter value: {st.session_state.counter}")
   ```

   In this example, the button increments the counter, and the updated counter value is displayed dynamically.

6. **File Uploads**:
   Streamlit allows users to **upload files**, such as CSVs, images, and other documents, to be used in the app. The file upload widget enables reading and analyzing user data interactively.

   **Example (File Upload)**:

   ```python
   import streamlit as st
   import pandas as pd

   uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a CSV file", type=["csv"])
   if uploaded_file is not None:
       df = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
       st.write(df)
   ```

   This example allows users to upload a CSV file, and the app will display the contents of the file.

7. **Caching**:
   Streamlit offers **caching** to improve performance. This is particularly useful when dealing with expensive or time-consuming computations, such as loading large datasets or training machine learning models. Use `st.cache` to cache function results.

   **Example (Caching a Function)**:

   ```python
   import streamlit as st
   import time

   @st.cache
   def load_data():
       time.sleep(2)  # Simulate a time-consuming task
       return "Data loaded!"

   result = load_data()
   st.write(result)
   ```

   In this example, the `load_data()` function is cached. When the app reruns, the cached result is used instead of re-running the function, reducing the wait time.

---

### **Detailed Examples of Streamlit Applications**

#### **1. Interactive Data Exploration Tool**

This simple app allows users to upload a CSV file and visualize different columns as a scatter plot.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

st.title("CSV Upload and Visualization Tool")

# Upload CSV file
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a CSV file", type=["csv"])
if uploaded_file is not None:
    df = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
    st.write(df)
    
    # Select columns for the scatter plot
    x_column = st.selectbox("Select the X column", df.columns)
    y_column = st.selectbox("Select the Y column", df.columns)
    
    # Create a scatter plot
    fig = px.scatter(df, x=x_column, y=y_column)
    st.plotly_chart(fig)
```

#### **2. Machine Learning Model Interface**

This example demonstrates how to build an interface for training and evaluating a machine learning model.

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

st.title("Machine Learning Model")

# Upload a CSV file
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload CSV data", type=["csv"])
if uploaded_file is not None:
    df = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
    
    # Select the target variable
    target_column = st.selectbox("Select target column", df.columns)
    
    # Define features and target
    X = df.drop(columns=[target_column])
    y = df[target_column]
    
    # Train-test split
    X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)
    
    # Train a RandomForest model
    model = RandomForestClassifier()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Make predictions
    y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
    
    # Show accuracy
    accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
    st.write(f"Model Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

## QUESTION: asynchronous execution in streamlit

1. **Streamlit is synchronous by default**: Streamlit scripts run from top to bottom in a linear fashion. If you want to use asynchronous code (like Promises), you need to handle it properly.
2. **Promises are a JavaScript concept**: Promises are part of JavaScript, not Python. In Python, the equivalent concept is **`asyncio`** and **`await`** for asynchronous programming.
3. **Using `asyncio` in Streamlit**: If you want to use asynchronous code in Python, you can use the `asyncio` library. Streamlit has limited support for `asyncio`, but you can make it work with some effort.

---

### Example: Using `asyncio` in Streamlit

Hereâ€™s an example of how you can use `asyncio` to simulate asynchronous behavior in Streamlit:

```python
import streamlit as st
import asyncio

# Simulate an asynchronous task
async def fetch_data():
    await asyncio.sleep(3)  # Simulate a delay (e.g., API call)
    return "Data fetched!"

# Function to run the async task
def run_async_task():
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    result = loop.run_until_complete(fetch_data())
    loop.close()
    return result

# Streamlit app
st.title("Async Example in Streamlit")

if st.button("Fetch Data"):
    with st.spinner("Fetching data..."):
        data = run_async_task()
    st.success(data)
```

---

### Explanation

1. **`fetch_data`**: This is an asynchronous function that simulates a task (e.g., an API call) using `await asyncio.sleep(3)`.
2. **`run_async_task`**: This function runs the asynchronous task in a new event loop. Streamlit doesnâ€™t natively support `await`, so you need to manage the event loop manually.
3. **Streamlit UI**: When the user clicks the "Fetch Data" button, the app runs the asynchronous task and displays the result.

---

### Limitations

- Streamlitâ€™s execution model is not designed for asynchronous code, so you need to handle event loops manually.
- If youâ€™re working with external APIs or long-running tasks, consider using **caching** (`@st.cache_data` or `@st.cache_resource`) to improve performance.

---

### Alternative: Use JavaScript Promises in Custom Components

If youâ€™re working with JavaScript-based components (e.g., custom Streamlit components), you can use Promises directly in the JavaScript code. For example:

```javascript
// Example JavaScript code in a custom component
function fetchData() {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            resolve("Data fetched!");
        }, 3000);
    });
}

fetchData().then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
});
```

In this case, you would need to build a custom Streamlit component to integrate JavaScript with your Python app.

## QUESTION: conditional rendering and callbacks

```python
# Example: conditional rendering of buttons

import streamlit as st

# Initialize session state to track button visibility
if "show_second_button" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.show_second_button = False

if "show_action_buttons" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.show_action_buttons = False

# Title

    st.session_state.show_second_button = True

# Second button (conditionally displayed)
if st.session_state.show_second_button:
    if st.button("Click me to show action buttons"):
        st.session_state.show_action_buttons = True

# Action buttons (conditionally displayed)
if st.session_state.show_action_buttons:
    st.write("Choose an action:")
    if st.button("Action 1"):
        st.success("You clicked Action 1!")
    if st.button("Action 2"):
        st.success("You clicked Action 2!")
    if st.button("Action 3"):
