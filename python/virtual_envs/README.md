# virtual environments stuff

tools related to managing virtual environments and dependencies. There's a LOT of different options

eg.

* `venv`/`virtualenv` (to create virtual environments) + `pip` (to manage dependencies) + `pyenv` (to manage python interpreter versions)
* `pipenv` (venvs + dependencies) + `pyenv`
* `uv` (all)

Imo you should use `uv`. Or at least i'd go with one of these, but there's a lot more... On the examples, i only use these 3 "technology set" options.
