    "### **Example 1: Predicting House Prices**\n",
    "Suppose you are trying to predict house prices using the following categorical features:\n",
    "- **Neighborhood**: A categorical feature with values `Urban`, `Suburban`, `Rural`.\n",
    "- **House Type**: A categorical feature with values `Detached`, `Semi-Detached`, `Apartment`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Cross:\n",
    "The feature cross of `Neighborhood` and `House Type` would be:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{Urban_Detached, Urban_Semi-Detached, Urban_Apartment,\n",
    " Suburban_Detached, Suburban_Semi-Detached, Suburban_Apartment,\n",
    " Rural_Detached, Rural_Semi-Detached, Rural_Apartment}\n",

    "  {0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0}\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "### **Example 2: Customer Churn Prediction**\n",
    "In predicting whether a customer will leave a subscription service, you might have these features:\n",
