# tree-based ML algorithms

## overview

The difference between tree-based algorithms in machine learning lies in their **design**, **purpose**, and **methodology**. Here's an overview of some common tree-based algorithms, including **Random Forest** and **Isolation Forest**, along with their distinctions:

---

### **1. Decision Trees**

- **Purpose**: A standalone model for classification or regression.
- **How it works**:
  - Splits data into subsets based on feature values, creating a tree-like structure.
  - Uses criteria like Gini impurity, entropy, or variance reduction to decide the splits.
  - Can overfit if not pruned or regularized.
- **Usage**: Simple models for small datasets or interpretable feature importance.

### **2. Random Forest**

- **Purpose**: Improves accuracy and generalization by combining multiple decision trees.
- **How it works**:
  - Ensemble of decision trees, each trained on a random subset of the data (bagging).
  - Each tree sees a random selection of features (feature subsampling) for split decisions.
  - Predictions are aggregated:
    - **Classification**: Majority voting.
    - **Regression**: Averaging tree outputs.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces overfitting compared to standalone decision trees.
  - Handles missing data and noisy data well.
- **Usage**: General-purpose algorithm for classification and regression.

### **3. Isolation Forest**

- **Purpose**: Anomaly detection.
- **How it works**:
  - A tree-based model that isolates data points by randomly splitting features.
  - Outliers are isolated faster (shorter paths) compared to inliers.
  - Measures "anomaly score" based on the average path length needed to isolate a point.
- **Advantages**:
  - Specifically designed for unsupervised anomaly detection.
  - Scales well with high-dimensional data.
- **Usage**: Detecting fraud, identifying rare events, or spotting anomalies in datasets.

### **4. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs)**

- **Purpose**: Optimized predictions by iteratively correcting errors from previous trees.
- **Examples**:
  - **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, **CatBoost**.
- **How it works**:
  - Builds trees sequentially.
  - Each new tree minimizes the residual error from the previous trees (e.g., via gradient descent).
- **Advantages**:
  - High predictive accuracy.
  - Supports regularization to prevent overfitting.
- **Usage**: Competitive machine learning tasks (e.g., Kaggle competitions).

### **5. Extremely Randomized Trees (ExtraTrees)**

- **Purpose**: Randomized version of Random Forest for faster training.
- **How it works**:
  - Like Random Forest but splits are chosen randomly, not based on the best criteria.
  - Aggregates outputs of multiple random decision trees.
- **Advantages**:
  - Faster than Random Forest.
  - Works well on large datasets.
- **Usage**: Similar to Random Forest but faster with slightly less precision.

### **Key Differences Between Random Forest and Isolation Forest**

| **Aspect**               | **Random Forest**                       | **Isolation Forest**                  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**              | Classification and regression.          | Anomaly detection.                    |
| **Data Splits**          | Splits to optimize impurity/variance.    | Random splits to isolate data points. |
| **Output**               | Class labels or continuous values.      | Anomaly scores for each point.        |
| **Training Approach**    | Aggregates outputs of several trees.     | Measures isolation path length.       |
| **Use Case**             | General ML tasks.                       | Outlier and anomaly detection.        |

### **Other Tree-Based Models**

- **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)**:
  - Foundation for many tree-based algorithms.
- **AdaBoost**:
  - Boosting method that adds weights to misclassified examples for the next iteration.
- **Holt-Winters Trees**:
  - Specialized for time-series forecasting.
